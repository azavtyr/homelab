# ðŸ§ª My Homelab Project

Welcome to my homelab project! This project documents my ongoing journey into building and maintaining a functional homelab â€” experimenting, learning, and improving through hands-on experience. It will evolve over time as I expand the infrastructure, add new services, and dive deeper into more advanced topics.

## Purpose & Goals

- Hands-on learning with real-world tools and systems
- Gain experience in:
  - Troubleshooting
  - Networking (firewalls, routing, VLANs, etc.)
  - Server management (VMs, containers, monitoring)
  - Automation (scripts, infrastructure as code)
  - Security best practices
- Document and track progress over time
- Build a scalable and upgradeable home infrastructure

## Current Hardware Setup

| Component             | Details                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Main Server**       | Lenovo ThinkPad T480 (Proxmox)             |
| **Router and Gateway**            | GL.iNet Flint 2 |

> [!NOTE]
> This setup is just a starting point. The current hardware is far from ideal for a full homelab environment, and I plan to replace or upgrade components as the project evolves.
